# DAuth

The idea is to exchange a token (QR-code) which is generated by a combination of name and passphrase.
This repo is for introducing decentralized authentication. Security measures are not taken yet. (see "How to improve security?")

# How does it work?

The component combines both inputs, name and pass. The QR-code is generated from the result (namepass)<br>
The exact same QR-code pattern is only generated again, with the right name and pass.<br>

# Sequence
At sign-up you generate a new QR-code from your name and a passphrase.<br>
The QR-code is generated from the combination of both.<br><br>

The first time you create a profile or post, this QR-code will be connected with your new profile or post<br>
```profile-creator: qrcode123 or post-creator: qrcode123``` (Pseudocode)<br><br>

This way, the profile or post "knows" who you are (which gives permission for edit/delete for instance)

```
// Pseudocode

{#if user = qrcode123}
{editmode}

{#else}
{watchmode}

{/if}
```

# Advantages

- Your name and passphrase are neither locally nor online saved. Just in your head.
- No user-database neccessary. The user basically generates himself on-demand, by simply log in.
- No database requests for permissions. The moment you load the post your permissions are set.

# How to improve security? (suggestions, Work in Progress)

- by hiding the QR-code
- salting the combined namepass
- encrypt the salted combined namepass value (maybe not possible since encryption algos generate random hashs)
- encrypted transfer of the QR-code (for instance Gun base64 encryption, then webcrypto AES or SEA)
- mechanism to make sure only 1 QR-code each user
